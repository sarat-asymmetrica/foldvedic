=== Energy Function Validation ===

Step 1: Loading native structure (Trp-cage 1L2Y)...
✅ Loaded 20 residues

Step 2: Calculating energies for native structure...

Original Energy Components:
  Van der Waals:         -5.71 kcal/mol
  Electrostatic:        183.76 kcal/mol
  Bond:                   5.43 kcal/mol
  Angle:                  7.59 kcal/mol
  Dihedral:               0.00 kcal/mol
  TOTAL:                191.08 kcal/mol

Enhanced Energy Components:
  Hydrogen Bonds:         0.00 kcal/mol
  Solvation:            -93.32 kcal/mol

Total Original:         191.08 kcal/mol
Total Enhanced:          97.76 kcal/mol
Energy Change:          -93.32 kcal/mol

Step 3: Hydrogen Bond Analysis...
  Number of H-bonds:     0
  Average distance:      0.00 Å
  Average angle:         0.0 degrees
  Average energy:        0.00 kcal/mol
  Total H-bond energy:   0.00 kcal/mol

  H-bond types:
    Helix (i→i+4):       0
    Sheet (long-range):  0
    Loop (short-range):  0

⚠️  Fewer H-bonds than expected (should be 10-15)

Step 4: Solvation Analysis...
  Buried residues:       0 (SASA < 20 Ų)
  Partial burial:        20 (20-100 Ų)
  Exposed residues:      0 (SASA > 100 Ų)
  Average SASA:          66.84 Ų
  Total SASA:            1336.84 Ų

  Hydrophobic burial:
    Hydrophobic buried:    1 (good)
    Hydrophobic exposed:   2 (bad)
  Hydrophilic burial:
    Hydrophilic buried:    1 (bad)
    Hydrophilic exposed:   16 (good)

  Burial quality:        85.0% (good burial patterns)
  ✅ Good hydrophobic core formation

Step 5: Energy gap analysis...
(Decoy comparison skipped - native structure analysis only)
