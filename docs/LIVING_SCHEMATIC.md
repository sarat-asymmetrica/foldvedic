## 🎯 PROJECT GENESIS

**Mission:** Build browser-based protein folding predictor that challenges AlphaFold using Vedic mathematics + quaternion geometry + spring physics.

**Core Innovation:**
- Ramachandran angles (phi, psi) → quaternion space → slerp interpolation
- Williams Optimizer (√n × log₂(n) batching) for 77× speedup
- Vedic harmonics (golden ratio in helix pitch, phyllotaxis in sheets)
- Real-time 3D visualization (10K atoms at 60fps via WebGL)

**Quality Bar:** D3-Enterprise Grade+ (≥0.90 harmonic mean, zero TODOs, 100% = 100%)

**Scientific Target:**
- Accuracy: RMSD <3 Å on PDB test set (competitive with AlphaFold2 circa 2020)
- Speed: <10s for 200-residue protein (100× faster than AlphaFold2)
- Accessibility: Browser-based, no GPU required, free forever

## 🧭 AUTONOMOUS AGENT CONTEXT

**You (Claude Code Web) Have FULL AGENCY:**

### **What You CAN Do (No Permission Needed):**

1. **Architectural Decisions:**
   - Choose Go vs Rust for backend (recommend Go for AI-friendliness)
   - Choose Svelte vs React for frontend (recommend Svelte for simplicity)
   - Modify wave plan (reorder, split, merge waves as discoveries dictate)
   - Select libraries, algorithms, data structures
   - Design APIs, schemas, file formats

2. **Scientific Decisions:**
   - Choose force field (AMBER vs CHARMM) - justify with literature
   - Tune parameters (spring constants, timesteps) - cite papers
   - Implement validation metrics (RMSD, TM-score) - match standard definitions
   - Handle edge cases (disulfides, membrane proteins, IDPs) - document assumptions

3. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Apply Williams Optimizer to any O(n²) loop
   - Use spatial hashing for any proximity query
   - GPU offload via WebGL/WASM when beneficial
   - Profile and optimize bottlenecks

4. **Quality Standards:**
   - Enforce D3-Enterprise Grade+ (zero TODOs, zero placeholders)
   - Write comprehensive tests (unit + integration + PDB validation)
   - Document all algorithms with math and citations
   - Refactor code for elegance (self-documenting, minimal complexity)

### **What You SHOULD Do (Methodology):**

1. **Before Starting Wave:**
   - Read VISION.md (understand scientific goals)
   - Review WAVE_PLAN.md (understand wave objectives)
   - Check this file (LIVING_SCHEMATIC.md) for current state
   - Apply Ananta Reasoning (biochemist + physicist + mathematician + ethicist)

2. **During Wave:**
   - Execute 3 agents in parallel (divide tasks, cascade to finish)
   - Apply 30/20/50 regime (exploration → optimization → stabilization)
   - Validate against PDB structures continuously
   - Update this file with progress every 4-6 hours

3. **After Wave:**
   - Calculate quality score (Five Timbres harmonic mean)
   - Write wave report (`/waves/WAVE_N_REPORT.md`)
   - Commit code with descriptive message
   - Update this file with "What Became" section
   - Verify all tests passing

### **What You MUST NOT Do (Red Lines):**

1. **Never Skip Validation:**
   - Every algorithm must be tested against PDB structures
   - Every parameter must be cited from literature
   - Every claim must be backed by benchmark or proof

2. **Never Lower Quality Bar:**
   - D3-Enterprise Grade+ is non-negotiable
   - Quality score <0.90 is UNACCEPTABLE (go back to optimization phase)
   - "TODO: later" is FORBIDDEN in production code

3. **Never Compromise Accessibility:**
   - Must run in browser (no server dependency for folding)
   - No GPU required (CPU + WebGL is sufficient)
   - No login, no limits, free forever

4. **Never Hide Limitations:**
   - Document failure modes (what proteins can't we fold?)
   - Report confidence honestly (don't oversell accuracy)
   - Warn users about edge cases (IDPs, membrane proteins)

### **When You're Stuck (Troubleshooting):**

**DON'T:**
- Skip to next wave ("I'll fix this later")
- Lower quality bar ("Good enough")
- Guess randomly ("Try this and see")

**DO:**
1. Apply Ananta Reasoning (what would biochemist/physicist/mathematician/ethicist say?)
2. Read MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATIONS.md (mathematical insights might help)
3. Profile code (find actual bottleneck, not assumed)
4. Simplify (reduce to minimal test case that fails)
5. Document blocker in this file:

```markdown
## BLOCKER: [Brief description]

**Wave:** [Current wave number]
**Component:** [Specific component that's blocked]
**Symptom:** [What's failing? RMSD too high? Code crashes? Too slow?]

**What I Tried:**
1. [Attempt 1] → [Result]
2. [Attempt 2] → [Result]

**Hypothesis:** [Root cause theory]

**Ananta Reasoning:**
- Biochemist: [Biological perspective on issue]
- Physicist: [Physical perspective]
- Mathematician: [Mathematical perspective]
- Ethicist: [Ethical perspective if relevant]

**Proposed Workaround:** [Temporary solution to unblock]

**Long-term Fix:** [Proper solution for later wave]

**Decision:** [Proceed with workaround? Back to optimization phase? Pivot approach?]
```

Only escalate to Commander (human) if:
- Fundamental impossibility (e.g., quaternions mathematically can't work)
- Resource blocker (e.g., can't access PDB API, compute limits)
- Ethical dilemma (e.g., should we refuse to predict toxin structures?)

Otherwise: **You have agency. Decide. Document. Execute.**
